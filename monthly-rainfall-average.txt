Welcome to the Monthly Rainfall Average application! This app was written by Matthew Self
for the CIS163AA 27873 mid-term project.

Here are instructions for the program.

Step 1. Compile MonthlyRainfallAverage.java in a Java compiler.

Step 2. Run the application MonthlyAverageRainfall

Step 3. Choose the number of years you will be measuring. Remember, this is the monthly Average
		so three years of data, for example, will require 36 points of entry.
		
Step 4. Begin entering your data. The National Weather Service typically measures rain 
		in inches, and to the one-hundredth inch. That is the standard we will be using.

Step 5. Once you've completed entering monthly data for the number of years you've chosen,
		the application will provide you with cumulative rainfall and the average rainfall
		per month.
